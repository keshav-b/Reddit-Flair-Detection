#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

## Tl;dr

With a view to address the public health challenges due to Covid-19 a range of technology interventions are being developed that impact personal privacy. We at IFF have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in India.  This includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data, specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications.

We devote substantial space to a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu. We also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between Apple and Google towards contact tracing.  To conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the Indian Supreme Court’s developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy. Over this week, we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time. It's possible if we try!

## Re-framing the Privacy and Public Health trade-off

The world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pick-me up videos from celebrities and influencers. A reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In these extraordinary times, it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends, family and colleagues in person.

However, there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic. This prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness. At the same time technology based solutions, in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the Covid virus. One such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater, common good is the Aarogya Setu App by the Government of India.

Recognising the digital nature of our society, we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by Covid. This must be done in a rights respecting manner, and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward.

## Overview of the working paper

This [**working paper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) is a comprehensive effort spanning 88 pages and 9 sections. The first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy. We have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy. Starting with the collection, use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine. Then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing. All three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations.

Following this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions, which we premise is based on growing trust. This can be achieved by respecting a person’s autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights. To illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions, the paper builds out a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu (Pages 59-73) in Section 7. We also look at the Apple-Google partnership and the promise that it holds, but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from trans-national, silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny.

Finally, we end with an appeal to policymakers stating, “.Adapting a silicon valley adage, if we move fast, we may just break more than things -- possibly, even democracy itself. It is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in India with an opportunity to pause, reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.”

## We have three primary objectives from this working paper

*A comprehensive map on Covid technology interventions:* Our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday. This is to document, analyse and then later pose solutions. We have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in India.

*Breaking the digital rights and technology development silos:* Today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations. These are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees. We hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy.

*Collaborative solutions for government:* We don't have all the answers. But, maybe if we work together, some credible suggestions can be made to the government. Covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to Government authorities. To facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) with the functionality for comment and review. In addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the [**Internet Freedom Forum**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).

## What does IFF plan to do with this working paper?

We will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller, digestible pieces. So for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps. This will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers. Based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government, technologists, academics and experts.

This working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance. For instance we have already filed RTIs to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions. More action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health.

I am currently in Bangalore and my mom's treatment is undergoing in BMS hospital. The doctor prescribed two tests to know level of infection but due to lockdown next day only, it couldn't be done. Now that hospital's lab person is saying I need to wait till end of the second phase of lockdown. The particular tests(HBV DNA QUANT, SAFP and other tests) are cheaper in this hospital due to tie up with NGO. If I get these done in other hospital, I need to spend three to four times more money. With no job currently and already bad financial condition, it's really a nightmare for me. I called government hospitals also but they are not doing any test due to COVID. It's not safe to take her to crowded hospital as she has diabetes also. Please tell me what should I do in this situation. The doctor told us to get the test urgently as situation is too critical. I have tweeted to pmo for this but I think it won't reach him as he must be getting  lots of tweets. If you stay in Bangalore and know where I can get these tests in less cost, kindly let me know. Thank you for reading till the end.🙏

I thought of sharing a few pictures and a perspective on this marvel of frugal engineering.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g12rep/my_tata_nano_turned_5_today_i_thought_of_sharing/,"I purchased a Tata Nano in 2015, 2 years into my first job. This car turned 5 today, and what a great companion it has been. We have other cars in the family, but this one remains my favorite, and even my dad loves it. It is super-nimble and comfortable, in fact, more comfortable than my Hyundai Xcent (I bought it in 2018 because it runs on CNG and is very cheap to run). The Nano seats in the front were designed for people who are 6 footers, and everyone gets surprised to be able to stretch their legs.

Looks like new after 5 years

The Nano is amongst the most famous Indian engineering products globally. Yes, a lot of folks in India shun the car because it ""makes them feel cheap"" and they'd rather buy a 3 lakh rupee bike or an expensive car on EMI to look cool. But when I did my MBA abroad, the Nano was the only Indian case study that was taught. People abroad love to investigate the innovations in the Nano, and at the same time look at it as a marketing failure because it did not highlight the ""aspirational value"" associated with owning a car in India.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j9olsirjars41.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5475f0071819f5b49cafc41a5ec6d2e6e4bbdb0e

5 years of ownership experience has been great. Tata service in the area I live in is superb- better than Hyundai and Maruti. They take the car from our house for service and deliver it back at no extra cost.

The Nano is a marvel, not only because of its price but because of the space it offers and the extremely innovative packaging. You won't feel tired even after full-day drives, which is not the case in most small cars. The AC is superb, the fuel efficiency is around 14 in the city and over 20 on highways.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ydlutfhlars41.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3a3091856d2c738e793a59467fba4c0f9b8b6f5

Some people say that the ""nano is unsafe and I'd rather travel in an Uber than be seen driving one"". I have never been in an accident in one, but I don't exceed 60-70kph on any road, and try being as careful a driver as the road allows. Airbags would have been great, but even without them, I feel safer in a Nano than a Maruti.

I wish Tata takes the lessons of the Nano forward and brings out more innovative products. Sadly, in India, innovation does not sell. People are more concerned about looking rich.

If you're looking for an inexpensive used car, the Nano is a great option. It costs around a lakh for models produced after 2015, and you will get a reliable, reasonably comfortable car that is a joy to drive on city roads. Avoid the cars made before 2012, because they had niggling issues. Thanks for reading.",Non-Political

g0ybrw,Got struck by a cop today,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0ybrw/got_struck_by_a_cop_today/,"I was out to get some meds for my mentally and physically handicapped niece. To my own fault of forgetting to wear a mask, I was stopped by a cop in civillian clothing and was asked what I was doing outside, to which I stated my reason and then was asked why I was not wearing a mask and told him the truth. I was then struck by the cop with a swat bat thingy thrice at that point, I decided to floor my bike and dipped out of there at fool speed. 

I can't help but rationlize why I was struck. My friend says that I was assaulted by the cop because he says that it wasn't the right for the cop to hit me, as he was also stopped by a cop when he was walking his dog for not wearing a mask. He then stated his reasons and then the cops told him to wear a mask and started petting his dog (My friend btw, is Indian and lives in a Middle Eastern country). Was it right for the cop to strike me? I can't help but think from both perspectives and always end up thinking that maybe I should've worn a mask, and this whole thing wouldn't have happened. What do you guys think?

Edit: Thank you guys for clearing up my views on the situation of what I had gone through. I didn't mention this but, I am sort of new to India, I came here like last year to complete my UG, so I didn't take into account that the Indian cops might have different perspective as compared to the cops where I was raised (i.e, Middle East). I admit that I was in the wrong for not wearing a mask, however, I don't think it was the right thing to do for the cop to hit me considering I showed him proof of reason as to why I was outside in the first place. 

Neither do I think that the cop had the best intentions in mind as I think he would've conveyed his point in a better way by actually telling me to wear a mask first. As far as I've heard, the cops in this country are far from the best but I shouldn't judge them individually based on what I may have heard but I cannot deny what I've heard or read anyway.",AskIndia

We have been overwhelmed with the response and feedback we received, so a huge thanks to the Reddit community. A lot of you have messaged us with ideas on what we should do next & some of you have joined our team as well to make things happen faster. The activity we have seen on our Telegram and WhatsApp groups has been heart-warming, where the members have effectively built a crowdsourced repository of things to watch, read and do at home. 

Our interactions with the community as well as with my own family members has given me the feeling that while people have been figuring out ways to keep themselves entertained, what has become more crucial to them is the need to stay informed.

So that everyone can stay informed and updated, with verified stats and news, we are launching [IndiaSmile **Corona Around You**](https://indiasmile.org/covid). This one page contains everything you need to follow the growth of this virus worldwide, delivered in a super-performant intuitive UI and regularly updated.

It contains:

* National & Local Covid Statistics -- Find the **statistics of your state, directly**.
* Global Covid Statistics -- Compare how other countries are doing, worldwide.
* National Testing Data -- **Follow India’s testing capacity**. As of the time of writing this post, India has tested a very small % of its population. See the graph to know how the government is dealing with this issue. 
* Regular News related to Covid -- all from verified sources, vetted by our team
* Distance to nearest covid case from your location -- Uses district-level data to **find the nearest infected case from you**, and provides a distance.
* Charts to monitor & compare date wise historical data -- Hover or click on charts to get more info.

While designing this page we paid special attention to neat UI/UX and wanted to deliver information in an easy to consume manner, so that every Indian, even if they are not tech savvy, can stay informed.

We are open to feedback, ideas & thoughts on how to improve this so that this can become an even better resource for people to stay updated. IndiaSmile is 100% non-profit and open source!

**Tl; dr**

In today’s speech announcing the extension of India’s national lockdown till 3rd May, 2020 the country’s Prime Minister requested citizens to [**download the** ***Aarogya Setu*** **application**](https://www.news18.com/news/tech/pm-modi-says-aarogya-setu-app-is-critical-in-the-fight-against-covid-here-is-how-it-works-2576857.html). Unfortunately, the application remains a privacy minefield and it does not adhere to principles of minimisation, strict purpose limitation, transparency and accountability. IFF’s Working Paper, analyses the application, highlights how it is inconsistent with the right to privacy, is conceivably a risk toward a permanent system of mass surveillance, and suggests clear recommendations to arrest these risks.

**Background**

On April 13, 2020 IFF released its working paper called,  “[***Privacy Prescriptions for technology interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view)”. A significant portion of this working paper is dedicated to the proliferation of experimental contact tracing applications not just in India but across the world. India has also launched its own contact tracing solution called *Aarogya Setu*.

IFF’s working paper was alert to this and Chapters 5-7 devote significant space in studying the emergent government and non-government practices, standard setting processes and first principles in the space. Chapter 7 of the paper studies three specific models of contact tracing including the Singapore Government’s *Trace Together* application, MIT’s *Private Kit: Safe Paths* initiative, and *Aarogya Setu*.

**What is Contact Tracing?**

According to the WHO, contact tracing occurs in three steps namely (a) contact identification; (b) contact listing; and (c) contact follow up. In particular, contact tracing is a pillar which helps public health officials in containing and the pace of transmission of the virus. This pace of transmission is measured by the unit R0 (R naught) which essentially connotes the number of people an infected person can spread the disease onto.

Contact tracing has traditionally been administered through the use of on ground personnel and volunteer armies. However, with the ubiquity of smartphones, which collect vast troves of personal information, governments across the world believe surveillance can aid with rapid contact tracing. But owing to the peculiarities of the coronavirus, authorities across the world are beginning to realise the limited efficacy associated with respect to location surveillance (both with cell tower data and with GPS signals).   


As a result governments and other groups have either released or are developing smartphone apps that use Bluetooth beacons or GPS signals to log instances wherein a user’s device comes in contact with another user’s device. When a user of the app is detected to have Covid-19, contact tracing officers might be able to use the app to identify their close contacts in the prior days or weeks.  


**What’s the Risk?**   


With the creation of such systems, come new risks of institutionalisation of mass surveillance. Critically, India lacks a comprehensive data protection law, outdated surveillance and interception laws, or any meaningful proposals for meaningful reform. In domains like disaster relief,  most apps which are purported as ‘contact tracing’ technologies, they often devolve into systems of movement control and lockdown enforcement.

A lot of technology solutions with no demonstrable scientific value to the national response can be passed off as being in the public interest. It leads to poor deployment of public resources and also makes it difficult for crisis responders to discern between “snake oil” and quality technology products. These risks are exacerbated in technology markets since there are no adequate checks and balances in development phases which ensure quality.

Such systems inadvertently discriminate against regions which have fewer concentrations of smartphones. Specifically, it can lead to harmful outcomes for people residing in economically weaker areas. In countries public health systems are already creaking under the looming threat of capacity deficits. If such systems wrongly urge people to pre-emptively take tests then there is a risk that public health systems may be overwhelmed prematurely.

It may also exacerbate the risks associated with the harvesting of personal data like health information, and also see the creation of new privacy invasive systems.

**How to prevent these risks?**

Such systems must consider embedding the following principles among others:

1. The usage of these applications should be voluntary
2. All data should always be stored locally on people’s devices
3. This data must be encrypted
4. No Government can access it at a later point, so must ensure nothing is centralised in a server
5. Governments must appreciate that any data from location information, to proximity confirmations, to health status, to whether they have been placed in isolation is sensitive personal information.
6. Privacy by design is more than just assurances that phone numbers are not recorded, all data is encrypted, pseudonymisation is deployed or that the use of the app is “voluntary” and based on consent. Most of these protections have known techniques of circumvention.  


Therefore, we need to adhere to two principles:

1. Strict limits  (in terms of collection and duration )every step of the way; and
2. Comprehensive evidence-based justifications every step of the way

**Aarogya Setu compares unfavourably to Singapore and MIT**

https://preview.redd.it/0zw655ssbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=488f2ca51d6a194e6858495a346eb42e072a2d5b

Consider the following aspects.

**Is this for disease control or for other purposes?**

In other countries, health authorities are leading the efforts to respond to COVID-19. For example, in Singapore only its health ministry can use these systems or have access to any limited data/interaction which is shared with them. European authorities are making similar commitments. They assure citizens that law enforcement personnel will not have access to these systems or the data therein.

In India, multiple committees have been set up in the context of *Aarogya Setu* or other technology responses to the coronavirus. But formal notifications nor press reports have any reference to major involvement of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Instead health authorities are being tertiary institutional players.

To protect people’s right to privacy, countries (including Singapore) say that contact tracing will be used strictly for disease control and cannot be used to enforce lockdowns or quarantines. ***Aarogya Setu*** **retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure comply legal orders and so on**.

**Minimisation? What Minimisation?**

1. Singapore monitors people’s interactions through Bluetooth beacons, MIT does it through GPS, and **then there’s India which uses both**.
2. Other apps just collect one data point which is subsequently replaced with a scrubbed device identifier. India’s Aarogya Setu **collects multiple data points** for personal and sensitive personal information which increases privacy risks.

**No Transparency leads to discretion**

The only information we have of the app is its frontend and its rather pedestrian Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy. Other projects release as much information as possible in pursuit of transparency. This may include an accompanying manifesto, technical specifications, general FAQs, and even its source code. Not only does *Aarogya Setu* go the opposite route but it also prohibits external good faith actors from reverse engineering the application for further scrutiny, information security and other related research which help facilitate stability.

Similarly, the app is capable of wrongfully identifying people as COVID-19 positive as admitted in the app’s Terms of Service. We ask in our report the question in our paper, does this mean people can get diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus based on an application rather than an actual medical test? Similarly, does this mean that a false positive entails that I cannot use public transport and go to work or leave the city to visit friends? This evokes imagery of the Chinese model of surveillance during COVID-19 and we have highlighted these risks as well in the report.

**No Accountability and No Auditability**

The Government has a blanket liability limitation clause inserted into its service agreements and privacy policies. This means citizens cannot hold the Government accountable or seek judicial remedy should they wish to ensure the Government’s processes are compliant with the right to privacy.

Second, the Government talks about certain obligations to delete certain personal data from its application after a 30 day time period. However, as expected this claim comes with enough exceptions which facilitate government discretion. This is compounded with the fact that both researchers and individual users cannot actually check if the Government has deleted people’s personal information and has no means of transparently auditing what the app is doing in the backend.

**Risk of Permanence and Compromises to Autonomy | The Anonymisation Gambit**

Finally, the app runs very palpable risks of either expanding in scope or becoming a permanent surveillance architecture. People are describing the current times as 9/11 on steroids. And with 9/11 we saw the creation and proliferation of mass interception capabilities for some governments. The Government has failed to provide any defined period by when it intends to review, delete and ultimately destroy its systems and data which is collected under the *Aarogya Setu* project. Second, there are already reports which confirm that this server is being linked with other government datasets. Such linking increases risks of permanent systems of mass surveillance.

Finally, the Government says that the TOS and Privacy Policy do not apply in any capacity to what falls under the category of anonymised data sets. The government cannot just say something is anonymised and aggregated so no longer personally identifiable without showing its citizens how it is ensuring this. This level of transparency is a minimum, since the vulnerability of anonymised datasets to people’s informational privacy and security is well documented in information security communities. Considering the risk of these anonymised data sets becoming permanent systems of data analysis, the Government has to keep itself accountable to public scrutiny.

**Conclusion**

IFF has addressed all of these challenges and many more when undertaking its case studies, and the paper eventually sets out a series of 17 recommendations to ensure people’s informational privacy are protected even in these uncertain times, wherein Indian authorities are viewing civil liberties as an afterthought.

Read details below",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g141sz/economists_of_rindia_can_you_give_your_views_or/,"Recently , I was reading an article on inflation and unemployment

>A.W. Phillips was one of the first economists to present compelling evidence of the inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation. Phillips studied the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages in the United Kingdom over a period of almost a full century (1861-1957), and he discovered that the latter could be explained by (a) the level of unemployment and (b) the rate of change of unemployment.

>Phillips hypothesized that when demand for labor is high and there are few unemployed workers, employers can be expected to bid wages up quite rapidly. However, when demand for labor is low, and unemployment is high, workers are reluctant to accept lower wages than the prevailing rate, and as a result, wage rates fall very slowly.

>A second factor that affects wage rate changes is the rate of change in unemployment. If business is booming, employers will bid more vigorously for workers, which means that demand for labor is increasing at a fast pace (i.e., percentage unemployment is decreasing rapidly), than they would if the demand for labor were either not increasing (e.g., percentage unemployment is unchanging) or only increasing at a slow pace.

Does this mean the current government's quest for low inflation is indirectly leading to unemployment going up .

Low inflation means companies and investors have no initiative to invest . However during times of inflation , investors look for places to invest their money in since it will keep on losing its  value if it kept ideal .

During Congress years of 2004-2014 , high inflation also most probably lead to increased consumer spending and expenditure. Since a large sector of Indian economy is dependent on internal consumption , it experienced significant growth due to it 


The reserve bank of India has been also extremely focused on fighting inflation . Many people are saying that this obsession with inflation is causing them to keep interest rates too high , as a result of which private companies have no initiative to borrow loans for new ventures


>As these examples of hyperinflation show, states have a powerful incentive to keep price rises in check. For the past century in the U.S., the approach has been to manage inflation using monetary policy. To do so, the Federal Reserve (the U.S. central bank) relies on the relationship between inflation and interest rates. If interest rates are low, companies and individuals can borrow cheaply to start a business, earn a degree, hire new workers, or buy a shiny new boat. In other words, low rates encourage spending and investing, which generally stoke inflation in turn.By raising interest rates, central banks can put a damper on these rampaging animal spirits

This is to help me teach others and also wonder how a Filipino could go about conducting research.

I believe European countries do research in their own language. The problem is they’ve had time to conduct science in local language as opposed to here, Bisaya.",Science/Technology

But he couldn't Google anything to back up his point, but he has some valid reasons, including some points from older books and quotes from Thiruvalluvar. My other friend says that we should just follow what ever the government has decided as they would have done more research on this matter, therefore 14 April is Tamil New Year.


I was having a hard time to research on this as I can't read/write Tamil, and Google wasn't helpful either. Would love to see any historians to shed some light in this matter for clarification, also any English sources that I can learn more of India's history.


I would appreciate if anyone can point me to some trustable resources (preferably in English). Some people say it's a political agenda, that is what Karunanidhi tried to change. 

My apologies if this is not the right subreddit for this topic, Happy new year tho.

The **Jallianwala Bagh massacre**, also known as the **Amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 April 1919, when Acting Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Indian Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. Over 1,000 people were injured.

Some facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:

1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.
2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.
3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.
4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.
5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.
6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.
8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi – the Sikh festival.
9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.
10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.
11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.
12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.
15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.
18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.
19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.
20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.
21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.
22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.
23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British
24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  ""Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves
25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while Asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"".
26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  ""The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything… When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.""
27. After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.
28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar’s Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.
29. Colonel Michael O'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.
31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

# Shaheed Uddham Singh

1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940
2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 
3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O'Dyer.
4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940
5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:

>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?

Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).

# Following his conviction, he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:

>""I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""  
>  
>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  
>  
>""I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.’ Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‘We are suffering from the British Empire.’ Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‘I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  
>  
>""I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.’  
>  
>""I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.’ ""Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.’  
>  
>""Your conduct, your conduct – I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.’  
>  
>""You people are suffering – workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying – British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.""  
>  
>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  
>  
>""You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  
>  
>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  
>  
>'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!""  
>  
>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table.

&#x200B;

His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.  On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.

These two are highly respected social activists who stood up for rights of Dalits. They've been spearheading BR Ambedkar's anti-caste movement in India.

\[1\]:  [A letter to Anand Teltumbde, on his way to jail](https://scroll.in/article/958222/a-letter-to-anand-teltumbde-on-his-way-to-jail)

They were framed in Bhima Koregaon case which you all know was transferred to centre (NIA) recently. IIMA Students/faculty wrote a letter to supreme court asking  inquiry into Prof Teltumbde arrest. They was charged under Unlawful activities act which was approved in 2019 and involves no conviction or trial. And the cases were transferred because they not longer had government in Maharashtra.

\[2\] Letter: [Statement of solidarity to Anand Teltumbe and Gautam Navlakha](https://caravanmagazine.in/noticeboard/statement-of-solidarity-to-acquit-anand-teltumbde)

And Dalits activists are far more threatening to BJP than english-speaking comedians. They've been trying their best to get these two arrested and we saw how they arrested Azad. We can't lose this battle. BJP never forms strong opinion about anti-caste movement because votes from a oppressed group is cheap and comes in massive numbers.

\[3\]. ['I Don’t See Any Anti-Caste Movement Today': Anand Teltumbde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEk9JUlIQTU)

&#x200B;

Now, finally how were they framed?

Firstly, the police claimed that they provocative speech in the Elgar Parishad event which led to violence. This wasn't proven and then they accused them of having maoist links and planning to assassinate Modi. They remotely placed letters containing ill-intent against constitution on their laptop which indicated such things. Few agencies including Amnesty and Caravan found out these irregularities. The police presented their laptops to the court and court declared them guilty.

\[4\]: [Bhima Koregaon case: Prison-rights activist Rona Wilson’s hard disk contained malware that allowed remote access](https://caravanmagazine.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-case-rona-wilson-hard-disk-malware-remote-access)

If you're smart in politics/caste-system/tech all of you have reasons to dig into the case. And raise awareness around you. If you've friends in IIMA, they can provide you with more accurate info. The students involved are from 2-3 batches. But in any case, do learn about the whole thing happening here. They'll be arrested on Ambedkar Jayanti.

Most people that I have seen buying car are the ones spending their entire year salary's equivalent sum of money buying something they don't really need. Some people even spend amount equivalent to their two year's salary on a depreciation asset like car.

I ran numbers in different ways and realised that it's not worth the price you pay. I also found a specific kilometre number (kind of like break even for car usage) if you drive above it annually then it makes sense to go for car otherwise not.

It's easy to get a car when going out with friends or family (zoomcar etc) if you need to commute to office then two wheeler or cabs or autos are sufficient that's what I feel.

I completely understand some people buy car for reasons like status in society, comfort etc. By no means am against them, just sharing what I think.

g0nkfo,Dealing with partner's past,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0nkfo/dealing_with_partners_past/,"27 yo here, and I am currently with my girlfriend for the last 1 year. We have a great understanding between us and we have opened up and talked about our lives before one another. I have grown up in a relatively conservative family. Although my parents were never against meeting girls (or dating one), I just could not devote any time towards it during undergraduate due to the heavy workload of an engineering degree. So this was my first real relationship and I am very happy with my partner (same age as me).

However, her undergrad life was very different, which included lots of drinking, partying, dating, sex, and several hookups. Today, she is very focussed on her career, makes healthier lifestyle choices (no more substances and drinking), and is making conscious efforts to make a life for herself that she can be proud of (she isn't proud of anything she's done in the past and has broken all ties with people from that time). To be clear, I myself have never indulged in alcohol, substances, partying, or hookups.

We both get along really well, and I have been trying to be very open-minded about her past (given that it is very much on the opposite side of the spectrum to mine). I don't want to sound regressive because I understand this happens, but I am unsure how to cope with the feelings of discomfort and off-putting mental images that come up in my mind. To add, we have decided to wait for sex until after marriage (if and when it gets to that stage in life). 

I want to deal with this because I respect her and want to be with her. Any suggestions?",AskIndia

g0kmhi,Comparison of expressway/motorway system of India/Pakistan/China,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0kmhi/comparison_of_expresswaymotorway_system_of/,"If we take a look at the expressway system of India and China and the motorway system of Pakistan, a lot of differences can be seen. 

&#x200B;

The length of operational expressways in **India** stands at 1,642.5 km: [https://i.imgur.com/FscRCi3.png](https://i.imgur.com/FscRCi3.png)

The length of operational motorways in **Pakistan** stands at 2,350 km: [https://i.imgur.com/KdZpPbW.png](https://i.imgur.com/KdZpPbW.png) (only the operational sections have been included in the calculations)

Whereas, the length of operational expressways in **China** stands at 142,500 km as of 2018 with planned expansion to 168,478 km by 2020, the list is as follows:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_NTHS\_Expressways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NTHS_Expressways)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Regional\_Expressways\_of\_China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Regional_Expressways_of_China) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_auxiliary\_NTHS\_Expressways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_auxiliary_NTHS_Expressways) 

&#x200B;

As it can be seen, the operational length in all three countries is drastically different. While China and India have a similar population, China has a far longer expressway system which tends to be designed more efficiently (fewer accidents) with better quality (more durable, more stops along the way with more facilites) and more lanes in general. Pakistan, on the other hand, has 1/6th the population of India but has a longer motorway system but still, it is far behind China.

This isn't a very fair comparison as there are more things to consider, Pakistan has a worse railway system than India and fewer airports even after adjusting for population. Some motorways in Pakistan are of better quality than India but some are in worse condition like the half-completed M-8 motorway and the M-9 and M-10 motorways aren't of a similar quality. China, on the other hand, has a far better railway system, more airports, etc. than both India and Pakistan. Although, India and Pakistan are both working on their respective railway systems, they are still behind (Pakistan is taking China's help in doing so). The need for longer expressways in China is crucial as it's more than 3 times the size of India (controlled area of 9,634,205 sq km vs  3,166,391 sq km) while some high-speed railway routes aren't as beneficial (but China still funds high-speed railway lines which lead to losses due to integration of far-off provinces) because of longer distances in some areas like in USA where airplanes are more preferred.",Non-Political

3) Badly managing matters (eg - Padmaavat protests)
4) Reports, international index position slumps (press freedom, happiness index etc)

g07a97,Do Indian restaurants actually use yeast to leaven naans?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g07a97/do_indian_restaurants_actually_use_yeast_to/,"Short version:

A  naan's crumb  seems to be just an airy bubbly layer and a bottom layer,  it is almost hollow in the middle, no bready glutenous structures,  image for reference: [https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg)   This makes me believe that it is not leavened with yeast but just  getting a lean flour on a high enough heat that seals the deal, so a phulka like internal structure, but with tandoor's heat you'd have the air bubbles in a phulka which collapse by the time you flip, actually crisped enough by the heat  to stay like that?

Long version:

I'm  experimenting with trying  to recreate naans similar to restaurants in  India, which I believe is primarily the trick of tandoors. While most  recipes do the yeast/yogurt, the end result always for me is closer to a  bread having the crumb of a pita and shape of a naan. I've seen   restaurants in European countries also do this, so I guess they leaven   with yeast, and this is relatively easier to recreate in home  conditions, this was my attempt [https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg)

Going  back to naans in India however, the crumb is more of a very airy   structure, with just the top & bottom layers, importantly it doesn't  at all actually have bready interiors like a pita,  a perfect example  is [https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally\_got\_my\_hand\_on\_some\_real\_naan\_and\_roti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_roti/)

The   post there claims that the bread only contained flour water &  salt,  no diary and importantly no leavening.  The more I'm  understanding a  bit about bread etc, the more I'm feeling it is just  the heat of the  tandoor oven and just a lean flour, maybe with a bit of  yogurt for  flavor /soda and not a yeast bread. Does anyone have links  to  videos/recipes from actual Indian restaurants? Most youtube videos  are  all from home cooks, where the recipe is either yeast/ baking   soda/powder, but trying all of them still gives a more ""breadier""  crumb   to naan, while I'm actually thinking naan is more similar to a tawa   roti's crumb, except that the internal heat in a tandoor can crisp the   top fast enough to stay there, while a tawa roti/phulka has a great air   bubble while roasting, but it doesn't sustain. I experimented this with   my sourdough discard for a bit of flavour and a soft wheat high gluten   flour (don't have atta) , so I did get a lot of bubbles similar to   naans, however, it didn't stay after flipping, similar to how a   chappati/roti on griddle would have bubbles, but don't survive to stay   bubbled. [https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ](https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ) ,

So   I guess a high enough heat to sustain the top surface heat would mean   that you could get away without actually leavening with yeast, or the   restaurants may use a bit of yesterday's dough which would mean a   sourdough style natural yeast doing the leavening?

fzzcgy,Endlessly refreshing for BigBasket delivery slots? Created a cross-platform program to notify you whenever a delivery slot gets available in your area.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzzcgy/endlessly_refreshing_for_bigbasket_delivery_slots/,"**Live at**: https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier

**Demo**: [Demo](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier/blob/master/screenshots/demo.gif?raw=true)

**Detailed Installing Instructions**: [Documentation](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier#installation)

---
This program gives you a system notification (cross-platform: Windows, Linux, OS X) whenever a delivery slot is found available in your current delivering address.


- Due to current pandemic crisis of Covid-19: A severe lockdown has been placed in India such that people look towards online services to get their groceries to them, BigBasket is one of the popular services providing all of the resources online. However, due to the excess demand, delivery slots get filled way too quickly for anyone to order items for their given address.



Some of the key features includes:

1. Cross platform system wide notifications.
1. You can login via OTP all by the terminal itself.
1. Ability to save your sessions allowing you to login only once.
1. Logging enabled by default for better debugging.
1. Configuration flexibility regarding various options.
1. Program doesn't do any javascript-rendering via headless browsers or anything.
1. Polling is done via API endpoints rather than relying on scraping improving stability.


Due to the current pandemic crisis of Covid-19, I advise to only order items that are necessary for your household chores instead of hoarding supplies that aren't needed per se.

I have made the documentation regarding the program as clear as possible such that anyone can install and start using it in their systems, However if you have any ideas to improve the section - Feel free to send a PR.

The program is completely *open source*, such that you can audit it yourself if you have any security concerns related to the matter at: [Github](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier)

If you’ve any issues in using program, or find any bugs or any other query contact me on twitter at: [@ugupta41](https://twitter.com/ugupta41/status/1249367355769016320)

But one of my closest friends is stuck in Delhi (Kalkaji, South Delhi). He was returning from Ranchi to his home in Noida after giving an interview there. Unfortunately, when he returned to Delhi, the same day, all cabs/metro/buses stopped working due to strict lockdown measures. And UP border as well as Delhi was sealed. Consequently, he could not reach Noida and had to settle for getting a PG room somehow but was still living in scarcity of food etc .He tried asking for police help from both Delhi and UP police, but no help. Now, the accommodation manager has increased per day rent to around  Rs. 1200/night. And with coming summer and further scarcity of food, etc., it is becoming increasingly tough for him to manage. All his savings are nearly finished. I tried to help whatever little I could financially. And hoped that lockdown would end on April 14 and he might move back to his home. But now with lockdown further extended, chances of his survival are getting really slim. Plus, there looks no definite end to lockdown to be hopeful.

I will be extremely indebted if any of you might help at the moment. If someone has a room available in a house and can keep him for a few days, that would be seriously life saver. He can still pay something for the room, but hopefully he will get to use the kitchen or something, so that at least he gets meals once a day. 

As I said, I know it's super awkward to ask for this kind of help at the moment and probably we won't get any. But I am trying with all my luck if some miraculous solution emerge. If it helps, he was already screened for Covid at Delhi airport and was tested negative. Also, he has been mostly living alone for the past few weeks and do not have any symptoms.

g06aaf,What are your thoughts on arranged marriage? And marrying someone with history of mental illness?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g06aaf/what_are_your_thoughts_on_arranged_marriage_and/,"I think that it is very important that a person reveals about their physical and mental health issues before marriage. Otherwise it will essentially be lying / withholding information.

Most of my friends married without revealing their struggles. I am talking about both male and female friends, from big cities and towns as well.

Obviously I don't know where they will be five or ten years from now. But as of now things seem to be going well.

Obviously I don't really know what exactly is going on in their personal lives.

The mental struggles do manifest although, and could be kept hidden for only so long.

I believe that some illnesses although are more severe than others, especially those illnesses that require antipsychotic medicines. As they can cause sexual dysfunction - erectile dysfunction.

So this could severely impact the quality of sex life of the couple. 

Other than that the mental struggles tend to be genetic. So the offspring is likely to have some positive or negative abnormalities. But it could be really positive too, as relatives of people with mental health issues can often be high achievers as well.

I myself have lived a life of honesty, so I never hide. Although people are quick to assume about the severity of the illness. And they being to imagine dramatic images of people who struggle with these illness.

So, it tends to become a conflict of interest.

So some people decide to keep things to themselves, because others might exaggerate for fun. And it might lead to them being Ostracized. 

I personally am not a big fan of marriage or seeking companionship etc although I want to conform with the social norms to some degree. And there always is interest of family members as well.

The [Mortality rate of Covid-19 in India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-covid-19-death-rate-lower-than-many-developed-nations-like-us-uk-medical-experts/articleshow/75084199.cms)  is 3.05, according to this [article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-covid-19-death-rate-lower-than-many-developed-nations-like-us-uk-medical-experts/articleshow/75084199.cms).

The mortality rate in US is about 3.57, in Italy around 12 and in UK it's more than 12.(according to the above article)

so about 3 people die per 100 cases in India. It's scary! but not too much.

currently, mortality rate is calculated by number of death per number of cases .

    mortality rate = Total Death / Total cases

currently in world, **1,806,436** active cases and **111,722** deaths.(the curve is nowhere near flat)

mortality rate = 111722/1806436 = 6.18% worldwide.

so about 6 people die per 100 cases worldwide. It's scary! still not too much.

let's assume an [infection rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) of 20% (20 percent of population would get infected in a span of [2 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#/media/File:1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif)). 25% is the infection rate for Spanish influenza and it didn't spread to many country as covid-19, the social distancing was not that great before and there were [three waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#/media/File:1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif).

&#x200B;

now, 20% of 7.7 billion people is 1.4 billion (very huge) and 6% of 1.4 billion is 84 million(estimated death toll). 

realistically, if the infection rate is brought down to 1%(by social distancing, lock-down, etc) the death toll would still be 4.2 million. (stay the f\*ck inside home, seriously)

&#x200B;

now, my real panic is that the current mortality rate calculation takes total active cases into account( the people who got infected and are still in hospital waiting for outcome.) eventually these people will either die or get cured.

Doesn't it make sense that we should only consider the cases which had outcome for mortality rate calculation?

    mortality rate = total dead / (total discharged or cured+total dead)

In this case, 

current mortality rate = 111,722 / (413,222+111,722) = 21.3% (that's huge) (numbers from [worldometer](https://imgur.com/a/E2HZnAI))

this changes everything.

now, if the infection rate is 1%(more likely estimate) the death toll would be 16.4 million.(holy f\*uck)

which makes this one of the worst pandemics in history. 

In [India](https://imgur.com/a/vOkmjyH), 

mortality rate = 331/(1080+331) = 23.45% (which is very high, above world mean) (why are scientists saying we have low mortality rate?)

Did gov officials know about this?  or they know and they are keeping it silent to not cause any panic?

BTW, the actions taken by Indian gov is by far the best in the world.(as far as i researched) . they did bring down the infection rate by a huge factor.

&#x200B;

please help me with these questions:

* Am i doing the calculation correct or did i miss any variable? 
* Does India have huge asymptomatic cases, which were not reported?
* How did china contain this? did china actually contain this or lying about the numbers? 
* because the numbers in china are nowhere close to other countries. their mortality rate (by second method - only calculating outcomes) is 4% while for the rest of the world is 21%. it never crossed 5% at any time(very suspicious). Their mortality rate is low all the way? why all the country have similar curve except china? 
* why India is relying on Chinese model in containing this Virus?  **India should not follow Chinese model** to contain this problem.(i know medical students who are lazy to do their maths). 
* how is it possible for China to contain this as the infection rate is very high .R0 = 2.2 for covid-19, based on Chinese study  for comparison seasonal flu in USA, has an R0 of 1.3 and roughly kills about 25,000 to 75,000 - 34,200 in 2018/19 (remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph).[chinese study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/) ,  for comparison seasonal flu in USA, has an R0 of 1.3 and roughly kills about 25,000 to 75,000 - [34,200 in 2018/19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html) (remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph).
* how can we model this in India? will India be f\*ucked if there were a community spread?

Can we get some volunteers who can send me materials on how to model this properly? I know data science, i can make a website. with your help i can make some valuable prediction on how this will unfold and will give you that information for free.

Red zones are hotspots with 15 or more cases, and there will be no activity in them. Orange zones have less than 15 cases and they will have limited public activity, like limited public transport. Green zones have no virus cases where restrictions will be relaxed. (They’ve not yet come out with a full list of relaxed restrictions in this)

My problem is a very obvious one: We are NOT testing enough. Because of this, we don’t actually have a conception of which zones are red, orange or green. That means because of the virus’ 2-week incubation period and the fact that it is asymptomatic means that there will be people roaming around without realising they are infected, causing green zones to also eventually turn orange or red. This would be possible if we had better planning, which we DON’T.",Coronavirus

Father served 3 months as a labourer after thr family left to pay back the money.

The previous worker before the family arrived was a bonded generation labourer (Generation contact) who had 20 Bighas of self owned land , but due to Bonded labour ,he was working here while his family was on other state.

The farmer was quite powerful ,owner of Buses, Petrol pums, School, Samsung Brand shops, Super stores , perhaps that could be reason that Police doesn't act.

Woh Safdar Hashmi ki den hai. He was born today.

Safdar Hashmi was an activist and street theatre artist. and later identified with the communist ideology as well.

He was a turning point for street play and street theatre in India. His work highlighting human rights and grassroots changes irked many in the establishment. He openly mocked Indira Gandhi's grab of power of the Emergency, to government actions, government apathy, the plight of the poor and uneducated in India.

He was killed while performing a street play after he was attacked by the goons of the Congress party.

In later years the government, played this very song as a public campaign on Doordarshan.

Safdar was not killed due to his ideology. He was killed because he raised his voice, he mocked the establishment. He inspired people to be aware of their rights, to question.

This is the story the world over. This is today as well. TOday's deaths get whitewashed by a pliant media, that does not mean fundamental issues don't exist today. Or that we have benevolent Gods in power in the government.

Narendra Dabholkar, MM Kalburgi, Govind Pansare , Gauri Lankesh are grim reminders today.

And the thing is that post corona if we survive there are more problems ahead of us. I just thinking our country is coming near recession. As i would be passing out that scares me. And surely somebody's gonna respond to china in one way or another regarding the virus.

g05iuj,My experiment with using bumble in India.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g05iuj/my_experiment_with_using_bumble_in_india/,"So guys this is gonna be a bit long.                                                               
So basically I was super bored with the quarantine and I was talking to my girlfriend about random stuff. So something about online dating came up. I made a bumble profile with 3 decent pictures , a good bio ,also verified account. Guess how many matches I got ( 2 in an hour and 4 likes lol) . Bear in mind both my girlfriend and I are about a solid 9 facially  (she's a bit better maybe) but my body is  a bit above average (good frame)with slight muscle but nothing too great, but I'm on the shorter side about  5'7(I'm in South Delhi) But I certainly expected waay better results based on real life experience, I really didn't know how bad the competition is.  I wanted to see how demographics are skewed so I asked my girlfriend to send  3 random selfies  for experimenting , also none of these were taken with a proper camera(just front camera selfies) without the best lighting. Also I had no bio besides a question and my profile was unverified.  I swiped to mostly hot guys 8+, and had a 90% match rate( ridiculous). All these guys looked like models  were tall , had bodies I'd assume from more than a year of solid gymming , had great photos taken by probably a professional camera and great bio and in general had a lot of effort put on their profile all to match with a low effort unverified profile.I got 350+ likes and 100+ matches in about an hour ,hour and a half I was basically bamboozled with disparity of likes even though both of us are similarly attractive. I understand the complaints of a lot of Indian guys on bumble etc about not getting matches, but the fault is on guys and especially Indian guys y'all way too thirsty and have no or extremely low standards( bumble doesn't have a lot of white guys, almost none) the pedestalising of girls is insane. You're basically competing with Indian version of ""Chad"" if you call that if you do use online dating. The average Indian guy isn't attractive but online  there's a shit ton of ""hot"" guys in North India and most are on tinder/bumble so you'd probably get close to no matches, let alone decent ones and thats even if you're above average and have put a lot of effort in your profile. A girl in India on online dating is basically God mode. So anyone here even if you're hot guy  ( You'll probably lose your value since hot guys are dime a dozen here and fucks up the standards of all girls in general.), if you want to go for online dating.   Don't.  
1. It basically spoils the notion of love in an insane way. Basically makes it a number game which is Frankly ridiculous to me. Someone with 100+ hot guys in their profile won't be able to emotionally attach ,let alone choose between who they want. It's one of the reason is never wanted to date online even after way too many of my friends told me to. It's near impossible to find love where there isn't real time energy or connection involved.  

2. It raises the standards of even somewhat decent girls to an unattainable level for most guys who meet her and even hot guys , since all they have to do to find a hot guy is install and app an swipe. Men are probably as expendable as ever. In real life attractive people you actually come across and interact with and get along with is rare and that what makes is special(chance for a spark).  Online dating basically just gives you a plethora of these attractive people sitting at home  reducing the chances of someone being special to you way less and having a moment of actual chance encounters.(I met my girlfriend in a library, Sorry I'm a hopeless romantic)

Please help me ... If any one here is a psychiatrist or in this field .. please advise me on what to do 


It started a few days ago , I was fine and doing well Until I watched a movie about someone being falsely accused , I got intrusive thoughts that I might get falsely accused too , and my fear was escalated when I realised that I have a pretty suspicious post history on reddit and search history too , so I got really scared that I'd be falsely accused , so I did a few Google searches about weather or not i'm being tracked by the government or not , and it came with scary search results so my intrusive thoughts shifted to being spied on and falsely accused at the same time , now I don't have a lot of friends but I really value the few friends I have so I was scared that this would hurt my reputation and I would lose my current friends and not be able to make new friends either .. then later on I got so anxious and thought ""what if I am actually a criminal ? The idea didn't bother me at first but then I googled ""surpressed memories"" and I got pretty scared as well , and had the thought that I might be actually a horrible criminal and have surpressed memories of it because I cant remember doing anything bad .... I had additional intrusive thoughts as well like this world being a hallucination and that maybe in reality I'm doing some terrible things .... I was extremely scared and had a lot of anxiety ... Then later on it shifted to my current fear .. That is going to *** .... This fear is based on a dream I had a few months ago I had a dream that my life would crumble down.... And that I'd be rejected by everyone and that I'd never reach my loved ones .... I was really going through panic in my dream ... And was contemplating suicide or drugs too .... There was a figure in that dream that resembled ryuk from the anime death note ... Who was mocking me about my fate.....Right now I feel similar to that dream ..... But I have reasons to believe that this might be true Because I've been noticing various signs like scary typos while typing and ads with specific wordings etc and events like me bringing a new charger and it not working afterwords ... And me having to lay down in a specific position so it charges while using it ... Having to eat bad food etc and My mom acting weird I saw two other anime called hell girl and Babylon which scared me too ... Because both plots resemble what I'm going through I'm really anxious at this point and don't know what to do .... I'm scared and always have a feeling like I'm being watched .... I even thought to myself that if I wear this specific clothing then something scary would happen and well ... I saw the hell girl cast and had a ""hallucination"" of making a deal with the devil .. or taking a loan from a hell bank now I'm scared of going to a bank or taking out a loan I was interested in anime and now I'm scared of it .... I was interested in banking stuff and now I'm scared .... Even now I'm witnessing scary typos too .... I don't know what to do... One reason I'm scared of getting help is because ... I think that if I let my guard down or feel relieved ... Something terrible would happen ... And in Babylon ... Help from nowhere worked for the protagonist almost .... This seems similar to me .. and I'm scared of it and hope it's not .... 


Even now I'm witnessing scary signs like word suggestions , scary co incidences , someone with the username ""naively idealistic"" messaged me with kind words ... This seemed like a supernatural warning .... One thing I forgot to mention is that a main character in hell girl three vessels saw her ambitions crumble and her succeeding the hellgirl .... I don't want this to happen with me ..

Fuck I'm even having scary medical symptoms  and disturbing  typos and  signs as if telling me to not Talk about this .... .. This all seems so scary and frightening ... I'm really scared please help me

Edit : it seems to keep on getting scarier ...


Edit : I'm scared of feeling even slightly relieved or talking about this because im scared of its  repucussions if any.. it's really frightening ..

Edit : I felt a strong earthquake that seems like only I felt , idk what this was .... Now I'm really scared even more ...

Edit : just remembered that there was another character in hellgirl who was accused of something and sent to hell , don't know if falsely or not ... Now I'm even more scared..

Edit : since I seem to be more concerned about being accused... And at times I'm not much anxious.... I'm really scared.... Fuck ... I am more scared about being accused ... I don't know .... What If I appeared like a manipulator or appeared normal to a psychiatrist ?.... 

Edit : what if I'm looking like one right now ? Please .... I'm suffering .... I'm not lying about being anxious ...

Edit : more scary signs and scary thoughts ... For example ""I'm going"" and ""I'm goin"" was in a text bar ... And my phone discharged too ... And some scary  warning etc  kind of typos ..... Even when typing now ( oof more typos) and non typos in some sentences .. even now scary signs

Edit : The earthquake was in Delhi  my area 
.... The epicenter too .... Which is scary ... Inmany ways

Edit : many of the themes in that anime seem really scary and similar .... Like regret etc ....and people sending others to hell but realising their mistakes since they go to hell too .... By doing so... And other situations leading to them regretting their decisions .... I'm getting so many scary typos and signs while typing this ...

Edit : I had  a dream when I was sleeping recently about being a big criminal on the run ... And I had a dream about reading about hellgirl on Wikipedia and how disturbing it is and Hell is , I had a negative dream again wearing the same sheet ... That I wore when I had my previous negative dreams .... It's so frightening .... And I had so many scary typos typing this.... Edit of this edit : the typos were really scary like warnings even now I think 


Edit : I'm still seeing scary signs etc .... For example a sinister smile shape in a cup of tea etc .... I'm really scared .... Im scared that maybe   innocent people can be sent to hell too.  

Edit : I saw something related to the thing I think I should have avoided .... Related to banking kind of ... And I'm scared I made the wrong decision by doing so maybe ... Even my phone discharged before .... For many minutes .... Im  scared that maybe this is a pattern or symbolic or manipulated ...

Edit : still witnessing scary signs

Edit : the second previous edit is scaring me ... I'm scared that maybe I shouldn't have seen stuff related to banking ... Because it seems so symbolic and patterned

Edit : I remember being really jelous of my cousin ... And hating him ... In hell girl you can send people to hell like i said .... I don't want to be in that situation .... I have an ambition that I'm afraid of having crumbled ..... I'm unable to put it in words right now and that's what scares me because of the repucutions if any ... Of it ... I'm having negative thoughts of my close people betraying me ..... Or looking like they betrayed me or crumbling my ambition ... And i doing something terrible like sending them to hell .... And going to hell as well .... I'm seriously scared ..... 

Edit : I even had scary medical symptoms again ....
 

Edit : I'm sorry to everyone who I've wished hell and anything bad on .... I'm sorry ..... 

Edit : I tried to copy paste this to 7 cups forums but it didn't work.... I wonder what it could mean 

Edit : I saw some things ..
 That I'm scared of there .... Now I'm scared ... I don't even wanna talk about it but I'm scared that this means something and might have repucutions ....

Edit : I'm scared almost everytime and scared that I'm being watched supernaturally ....

Edit : soooooooooo I was watching hentai ... And a poster had the username ""lifeanddeathsworld"" and another ""deadstar"" ... Scary....",AskIndia

So if y'all could drop 1-5 songs that you think need recognition that would be great.

This is my first post on reddit, although i have been following reddit for past 2 years. 

Countries like Czech republic and Taiwan have kept spread of virus under control by ensuring everyone wears it. This was a totally new thing for Czech Republic but as a nation they have responded amazingly. 

Me and my friends think, we will eventually have to do this in India, even after lockdown is removed. Also mass production and distribution of masks to all with take time. 

 We all have time and can contribute to this by all making a DIY mask. There are studies which clearly say that it reduces the growth rate of masks. 

We have started a #masks4allChallenge on FB and Twitter along the lines of Ice bucket Challenge which has following steps

\- Make a DIY mask  
\- Share with someone in your surrounding  
\- Tag 3 friends to take up the challenge and ask them to share in their timeline

On 13th December 1971, US President Nixon redirected the 7th Navy Fleet led by the 75,000 ton nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, the most powerful warship in the world at that time, to go to the Bay of Bengal to stop India from liberating Bangladesh

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi promptly called on Moscow to invoke a secret provision in the India-Soviety treaty under which Russia was bound to defend India in case of any external aggression. Russia sent a nuclear armed flotilla including a Nuclear submarine from Vladivostok on 13th December, 1971 under the command of Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, who has orders not to allow the US Fleet to advance and attack the military bases of India. 

The only thing standing between the US Fleet and the Indian cities was the Indian Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant and the Russian fleet, so India and Russia came up with a crafty plan to stop them. 

As the US Aircraft carrier was entering the Bay of Bengal to attack India, for the first time in human history the Russians decided to intentionally bring their Nuclear submarine to the surface and let the Americans see them.

As soon as the Russian Submarine surfaced on the Bay of Bengal, the US Admiral lost all hope and made the following quote 'We are too late, the Russians are already here'
The mere fact of seeing Russian nuclear warheads in the Bay of Bengal changed America's mind and they retreated.

Russia further went on to say 'A war on India will be considered a war on Russia' and threatened China to not join the conflict on orders of the US and threatened to sink Sinkiang (a region in China) if they tried to stop India from liberating Bangladesh.

Ever since then India has considered Russia as their most trusted ally in the world and is now the largest importer of Russian weapons and Nuclear Reactors in the world.

I posted this in r/Indian_Academia but didn't get any responses. Posting here for better visibility. 

Sorry for a long post but I would really appreciate some career guidance.

I'm gonna give you a brief background of my situation. I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Statistics, Mathematics and Economics (from Christ University Bangalore if it matters). During second year of college I really got into skateboarding and was desperately trying to make it work as a career option. I worked with Holystoked collective (they are the pioneers of skateboarding scene in India), built a skatepark in Bangalore with them and life was amazing. But towards the end of my undergrad I injured my knee pretty bad and things went downhill from there. One injury led to another and before I could realize, I had a knee issue, back pain, hip pain and what not. I was in poor health and it eventually took toll on my mental health. Long story short I pretty much wasted a little over one year. In 2017 I got my shit together and wrote the entrance test for writing actuarial exams. I started writing actuarial exams in 2018 and cleared 4 Core Technical exams by the end of 2019. I was going to write two more exams this April but our exams got cancelled due to COVID 19 pandemic.

Now, I've been looking for an actuarial job for some time now and realized that its really really hard to get a job without contacts or college placements. I have also been learning data sciece and machine learning with python, as I already have a solid maths and statistics foundation, so as to get a data science or data analyst job and then perhaps switch to actuarial eventually. But now with an almost inevitable economic recession looming over our heads, I'm a little worried about my career.

Could someone please guide me? Where do I go from here? Should I keep looking for jobs? Even if I do find a job I don't expect it to be more than 5LPA. Or should I go for higher education? Would an MBA in Finance or Business Analytics make sense?",AskIndia

I am an American woman (26), dating a South Indian born man (32). Even though we come from contrasting backgrounds, we share the same religious beliefs (we're both Hindu), morals, and attitudes. Recently, he told me that he loves me and wants to marry me, but there is one problem: his parents. 

His parents want to arrange a marriage for him. I'm not against this practice, but I happen to love this man, and I couldn't imagine a life without him (I know, very cliche). 

I understand that since I am not an Indian woman (I'm  African-American and white), was raised Muslim (I practice Hinduism now), and that I am also the offspring of divorced and twice-married parents, that there is no way in hell my boyfriend's parents are going to approve of our marriage. 
My boyfriend is asking me to stay hopeful and travel to India with him this year so that his parents can meet me. During that time, he plans to ask his parents for their approval. 
I have been in two previous relationships where my ex-boyfriend's parents disapproved of me because I was black...and those relationships simply ended because they chose their parents over me. 

So, my question is, should I have faith in this relationship? Even though my gut is telling me that I'll never see myself married to this man? Or should I leave now before I'm disappointed and heartbroken in India?",AskIndia

fzs3p8,An Honest Conversation About Demonetization,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzs3p8/an_honest_conversation_about_demonetization/,"***Long Post Warning***

Please note I'm only looking at the big picture. I'm not trying to minimize the suffering of lakhs, just want to get an overall view of DeMo and its effects on the economy, black money and the tax base.

**The Good:**

* Under the new Amnesty scheme,  ₹4900 crores of unaccounted income was declared by around 21000 people. (Source - [Rs 4,900 crore black money disclosed under PMGKY, Rs 2,451 crore tax collected from it)](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/black-money-rs-4900-crore-disclosed-under-pmgky-rs-2451-crore-tax-collected-income-tax/story/259891.html)
* Over 2 lakh shell companies (corporations that exists only on paper and are often linked to money laundering and movement of black money) were struck off by the government, rendering them illegal. (Source - [India Cancels 2.24 Lakh Suspected Shell Companies Post Demonetisation](https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/india-cancels-224-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation))
* In similar but separate action, around 3.09 lakh board of directors were disqualified for their companies failing to file financial statements and/or annual reports for a continuous period of three financial years. (Source - [Govt cancelled 2.24 lakh suspected shell companies post demonetisation, disqualified 3.09 lakh directors](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html))
* 48 per cent increase in deposits in Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts, with addition of 18 million accounts post-demonetisation (November 9 to January 25, 2017). The latest data indicate that 38.2 million new accounts were opened until July 26, 2017 since demonetisation. (Source - [Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_Demonetisation.aspx))
* India witnessed a great jump in the account ownership during 2014-2017 as 80 percent Indians owned a bank account in 2017; there were only 35 percent bank account holders in 2011. Please note this is in(significant) part due to the PMJDY accounts. (Source - [55 percent of all new bank accounts in the world opened from India: Global Findex Report 2017](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/19-crore-indian-adults-do-not-have-bank-accounts-global-findex-report-2017-1524203973-1))
* Several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including GST have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (Source - [Demonetisation, GST impact: India is fast ceding gold market share to China](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* Much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. DeMo paved the way for new acts such as the RERA which further increase transparency. The immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (Source - [Demonetisation impact: Real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). The real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability. (Source -  [Impact of demonetisation on real estate recedes](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/impact-of-demonetisation-on-real-estate-recedes-117061400058_1.html))
* Direct Tax collection has increased siginificantly due to DeMo. Corporate income tax grew at 14% and Personal income tax grew at 13%. Net collections increased by 17.1% in FY18 and 14.6% in FY17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. Since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in FY16 to 1.3 times in FY17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in FY18.  (Source - ['Direct tax collection up since demonetisation'](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/direct-tax-collection-up-since-demonetisation/articleshow/69077749.cms) and [What demonetisation did to tax collections](https://www.thehindu.com/business/what-demonetisation-did-to-tax-collections/article23550004.ece))

**The Bad:**

* Labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.Labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. In the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. The unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018. (Source - [50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation, says Azim Premji University report](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/jobs/50-lakh-people-lost-jobs-since-demonetisation-says-azim-premji-university-report/story/337980.html))
* In the immediate aftermath of DeMo, MSME's were the most badly affected. Small businesses with no access to PoS machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. This inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (Source - [Demonetisation: Indian SMEs suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* The manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw just a 4.9% growth in November, compared to 6.6 percent in October. (Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. The pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the Wholesale price index (WPI) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of DeMo. (Source - [How demonetisation affected the Indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ySbMKTIC4MINsz1btccBJO/How-demonetisation-affected-the-Indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* A systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. The performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (Source - [INDIAN DEMONETIZATION AND THE LIQUIDITY CONUNDRUM](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* Economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. Please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as DeMo and GST further aggravated the issue. (Source - [Demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: US Study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**The Ugly:**

* The excercise led to the death of several people, and caused immeasurable distress to a significant percentage of the population. I don't feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post.

A couple more points I'd like to add:

* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.
* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

Summing up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post. Thanks for reading.Please let me know if I missed anything and I'd be happy to update my post.",Policy/Economy

1. The women in the gang would've already filed for sexual harassment, profanity and indecent behaviour even before the heist..

2. Moscow in his death bed would've revealed Monika was Denver's step sister 🤷🏽‍♂️

3. Professor starts taking class. The bitch Tokyo will already be messing since she hates Berlin and isn't in charge of the heist. Rio is terribly in love that he never listens to any class or keeps bunking classes and blindly listens to anything Tokyo says . Tokyo plans a riot against professor and Berlin. The plan is ruined. 

4. The female hostages would demand a separate accommodation.

5. Don't even think of the hostages changing to jumpsuits scene to be so smooth, everyone would demand a privacy 😁

6. Everyone, even after the 11th day would still have the perfect hair, makeup and those who have torn suits would have it in the right places to show off THEIR perfect biceps, abs  chest etc 😃

7. Also there would be atleast a 2 dream sequence songs.

8. Boman Irani would play Arturo Roman 

9. Their hideout during the 6 month training period would be in Leh/Ladakh or Darjeeling. 

10. Dali masks to replaced by that of BigB or Sachin Tendulkar.

11. And all this Smoking /Drinking and Abuse against women disclaimers.

12. After the success of Season 2. The role of Professor would be played by Salman Khan or Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif or Sonakshi would replace Tokyo/Nairobi in the subsequent seasons.
Role of Stockholm would be reserved for a newcomer - Probably a Star Kid..Ananya Pandey or Jhanvi Kapoor?? Coz you need to reserve one for Nepotism!

13. Modiji would've gone for Demonetization 2.0, the day after the heist is complete. #MasterStroke

I am not here to rant and rave but to show the true face of the corporate greed which clearly indicates that there's something wrong with all of this.   


To begin with, I am an entrepreneur and freelancer, having a line of credit that too with a limit of just 10,000 INR is not all that bad. However, when COVID-19 struck, I lost my clients and the due receivables from my prior clients were also stuck up. Quite reasonably, I would need to worry about my survival in a city like Mumbai and thus had whatever little I saved up in my accounts cashed due to obvious fear of not being able to pay for basic commodities. However, Slicepay through its clever legal loopholes and fuelled by its corporate hunger would not consider even a moratorium. Constant threats and random people claiming to be ""recovery agents"" have called and texted me. Even after a telephonic call with their actual staff who said I can pay it later with higher interest which I agreed to, even after that I have been completely harassed on a regular basis. 

So what is the takeaway? Well, for starters if you were thinking about this service think again. I am not an isolated example, thankfully I am a law student and caught their BS when they called my friend who also defaulted for the same reasons and said that they're in police station and are filing FIR.

But why do most of us choose to work at jobs instead of taking risks by doing something else like a start-up or taking jobs with high risk? I am not saying that working at a 9-5 job is bad, but atleast some good percentage of us should have been risk takers, right?

In my opinion the reason why Americans are more successful is because they take huge risks and they either payoff or they fail and they go in debt. We should be able to take risks because even if they fail most of our parents are happy to bail us out compared to the western parents. 

Please note that I am not judging anyone who works at a no risk job. I was just wondering why as a country we all do this. I also understand that the risk taking culture has improved in the past few years.

India supports all forms of innovations in the diagnosis, [treatment](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/), prevention, and spread of COVID-19.

We keep hearing many heart-touching stories of researchers and doctors working to combat this dreadful disease. Here is a gist of what the innovation community of India is up to and how our Government supports them.

##### Innovations across the Country

###### Triple-Layered Anti-infectious Gloves 

About 8.3% of the total cases in Italy are health workers who treat and take care of infected people. A team of Indian youngsters from Viral Brain System have realized the seriousness of this issue and have designed triple-layered gloves that are anti-infectious. The gloves not only protect the user’s hands but also disinfect everything the personal touches while wearing the gloves. These gloves, once opened, can be used for a maximum period of three days. The inner and outer layers of the gloves are made of latex, while the middle layer contains the sanitizer or any disinfecting chemical. The prototype is in testing and can be expected in the market soon.

###### Anti-bacterial Clothing

[Thermaissance](https://thermaissance.com/), a startup from the GTU-incubation center, has come up with specially designed anti-bacterial clothing for hospital staff. The innovation makes use of nano silver-based technology that is capable of destroying both positive and harmful bacteria. This reduces the risk of exposure and spread of diseases among hospital staffs that are in close contact with the COVID-19 infected people. They have also come up with cheap, anti-bacterial masks tested in a NABL accredited laboratory in Mumbai for their authenticity. The masks offer 99% protection from germs even after 60 washes.

###### Colour-changing Mask

A three-layered color-changing mask to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus is at the concept stage of innovation by the [Babaria Institute of Pharmacy](https://bitspharmacy.org/). The mask prevents the entry of Coronavirus and also acts as an indicator when exposed to the virus. The membranous layers of the mask consist of enzymes and chemical reagents that can copy DNA to RNA. When the mask comes in contact with Coronavirus particles, the mask constituents react with the virus and form a solid pink color. The change in color will indicate exposure to the virus.

###### 3-D Printed Toothbrush

The innovation from the startup, Pragratham, addresses the importance of oral hygiene in the survival rate of corona virus-infected persons. This toothbrush is specially designed for COVID-19 patients in ICU. This open-source design requires a 3-D printer and cotton gauze to construct the toothbrush. It takes an hour and 45 minutes to produce a single 3-D printed toothbrush. The product has received positive feedback when tested.

###### The Quarantine Watch App

The senior IAS officer Munish Moudgil with his team in Karnataka has launched India’s first unique mobile app to facilitate active tracking of people in quarantine. The application works on both android and iPhone platforms. The home-quarantined person should download the app, fill in essential personal details, and send selfies. The system will identify good resolution selfies, and officials from the District Photo Verification team will check for the originality of the selfie. The application has also enabled GPS tracking to trace their whereabouts effectively.

###### Online Training Programme

The Karnataka Government has launched a 1.30-2.00 hour training programme to train doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The programme is freely accessible on YouTube. The programme helps doctors to prepare themselves and also teach them on specimen collection and transport, clinical management, and supportive therapy for COVID-19 patients.

###### Sanitization Units

PadCare Labs, a Pune-based startup, has designed a sanitization unit to disinfect the surface area. The unit working on the principle of UV mechanism can disinfect an area of 80 sq ft with a 99.99% bacterial reduction in 15 minutes. The organization will be installing the units in a local hospital soon.

###### C-CAMPs Initiatives

The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms ([C-CAMP](http://www.ccamp.res.in/)) has launched COVID-19 Innovations Deployment Accelerator (CIDA) to identify and support innovations that help in combating Coronavirus. The program has partnered with Social Alpha, United Nations Health Innovation Exchange (UNHIE), India2022 Xynteo, India Health Fund, MedTechConnect, AIC-CCMB, and CCMB to select innovations and develop them to large scale applications. The companies with projects towards the following criteria were nominated for funding.

###### Preventative Measures

[Anabio](https://www.anabio.ie/) Technologies Pvt Ltd works on innovating new preventative technologies that offer better protection than the existing ones. The technology from this company aims to transform a mask or a regular cotton cloth into a protective agent against Coronavirus. This technology will work on meeting the needs of N95 masks and other personal protective equipment.

###### Diagnostics

There is a rising need in India to perform mass-testing to identify and isolate people infected with COVID-19. CoSara Diagnostics Pvt Ltd and Ampligene Diagnostics Pvt Ltd are working on developing easy-to-use, affordable, quick, and accurate diagnostic technologies.

###### Respiratory Devices

5-10% of the Indian population will require ICU in the event of community spread in India. There is a rising need for invasive and non-invasive respirators to treat critically ill patients. US FDA has approved the use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machines (CPAP) to meet the scarcity of ventilators. Coeo Labs and Avyantra are working on innovations in the mass production of respirators to achieve this scenario.

Many such innovations are going around in the nook and corner of our country to fight back COVID-19. Our Government has also launched several incubation programmes to encourage innovators working on combating this dreadful disease. The active contribution from young [entrepreneurs](https://www.intepat.com/blog/intellectual-property/intellectual-property-rights/) and researchers is inevitable to serve our country during this massive health crisis.",Coronavirus

>The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 was passed by the [Parliament of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India) on 11 December 2019. It amended the [Citizenship Act of 1955](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_nationality_law) by providing a path to Indian citizenship for illegal migrants of [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus), [Sikh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs), [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist), [Jain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain), [Parsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsis), and [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians) religious minorities, **who had fled persecution from** [**Pakistan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan)**,** [**Bangladesh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh) **and** [**Afghanistan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan) **before December 2014**

Without getting into whether the act itself is acceptable or not, it seems to me that even if there is a Pakistani Hindu facing religious persecution today, they would not be eligible for the fast track to Indian citizenship that CAA provides.

As per the procedure,now home ministry is one of the most important in current condition , but Amit shah who can confidently take press conferences unlike his guru is seen nowhere.

Was having a chat with a old friend who is a gujrat based journalist, he was saying that Modi dreams have got bigger and he is now aiming to become somewhat of a global icon and dreaming of a nobel prize like Obama , the reason we see him buttering international leaders like Trump and Jinping.Modi is also video conferencing other chief ministers and taking stock of this pandemic albeit in a very democratic manner.

Few months back, he has instructed party top brass to keep Hindu-Muslim politics aside as he will go for a image rebuilding in the coming years.
But Shah is Shah, his entire political career is based on communal politics, and he is quite dope on that and cannot survive if he doesn't do his regular drama. 

We can see the notorius UP police filing FIRs on news channels on false reporting of Tabliki jamaat attendees , it was an outcome of Modi giving a stern warning to party top brass to not give a communal twist to corona pandemic. 

Congress has a godfather culture ,where party leaders usually don't topple their godfather.
But BJP is quite opposite where there is a culture of outsmarting their gurus., be it Modi-advani, Gadkari-fadnavis, Shivraj-Vijayvargiya., Maybe Amit shah was also planning the same and was getting bigger for his shoes, hence his wings are getting clipped .",Unverified - Opinion

fzfkko,Lives & livelihoods in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzfkko/lives_livelihoods_in_india/,"Lives and livelihoods

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.",Policy/Economy

Facts why direct donation is the best:

* Instant result
* Credit goes to you, not authorities who collect the cash from you
* Lot of love from the receiver <3
* no fees, full money worth
* karma bonus points ;)
* helps keep starvation away
* more..

The execs of the top US companies who have tonnes of money as it is , I'm not sure exactly, but messed up. Didn't save any money, kept reinvesting profits in their own stocks so that company value goes up and now are basically going through heavy losses and have put the jobs of citizens at risk plus they want the government to use taxpayer money to bail them out.

And from what I gather these companies will remain privatised and won't be nationalised.

There is an uproar within the US against this and a comment I really liked stated ""Why should the profits be privatised and losses be socialised"" 

Anyway, I want to know what the policies are like in India. If India has similar policies and private companies in India will go through the same thing?

fz4rsf,India to extend lockdown by 2 weeks,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fz4rsf/india_to_extend_lockdown_by_2_weeks/,"India is set to extend its nationwide lockdown for another two weeks, until April 30, as its confirmed coronavirus caseload continues to soar, with no sign that the severe restrictions on most economic activities have flattened the curve.  India confirmed its highest ever daily number of infections at 1,035 over the past 24 hours, health ministry officials said. This brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus patients to nearly 7,500. Of those, 642 have recovered, and 239 have died.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi engaged in a four-hour dialogue with chief ministers of Indian states on Saturday to discuss whether to lift the lockdown, which has caused extreme hardships to India’s hundreds of millions of casual and informal sector workers, whose incomes have collapsed since the restrictive measures were introduced on March 22.  Mr Modi made no official statement or comment after the meeting concluded. But Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of New Delhi, made it clear that the lockdown would not be lifted on April 14, when it is currently due to expire. Mr Modi is expected to address the nation on Sunday or Monday night about the extension.  Analysts and industries expect that Mr Modi may announce some relaxation of the restrictions for farmers, who are poised to harvest their annual winter wheat crop. Industrial businesses, especially exporters, are also hoping for some relaxation for manufacturers so they can maintain the supply of essential items, and fulfil international orders.  However, all India’s public transportation systems -- including urban metros rails, the railway network, and all domestic and international passenger flights -- are likely to remain suspended.

-------------------
>there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,"" Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.

It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing, and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,"" she said.

>With 40 million people, ""even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected."" (USA)

Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.

f9outu,Fuck all Religion,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9outu/fuck_all_religion/,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

38heyu,"Help, ideas needed. HLL poisoned my village with mercury. There have been 250 cancer deaths in just 5 years in just my tiny village. Se[r]ious replies only.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/38heyu/help_ideas_needed_hll_poisoned_my_village_with/,"I don't want to leave this be, and need some help on which NGO's might be interested in fighting this case.

**Background Reading**

* [Kodaikanal mercury poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal_mercury_poisoning)
* [Unilever's Mercury Fever](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=624)

The summary of these articles would be as follows,

A company called Ponds moved its thermometer factory from the US to Kodaikanal in 1982.

HLL took over Ponds, ran operations till 2001.

A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.

What has been ignored because of lack of visibility is the plight of my village (which I will not name). My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.

I have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 

If you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.

I want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO's...ideas are welcome.

Further studies in case you are interested.

[Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal](http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm). 

[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).

>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 µg/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 µg/kg and 8.3 µg/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.

>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That's no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.

This article talks about a town 130 Km's away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km's by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn't matter to us. 

Edit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don't want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.

edit 2 - Guys, have received PM's from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.

To be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.

edit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.

I will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.

Thank you. Just to reassure you (that I am not misusing the goodwill of the forum) the issue is real, maybe the cause is not mercury directly, but something is poisoning my village and my post was and remains well intentioned and not a ""troll post"" as a few have alleged via PM.",[R]eddiquette

These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a “daredevil selfie” when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. 

The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.

**Actual Events:**

Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. 
The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngsters’ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.

**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.

All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. 

I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.


This is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. 

For Pranita.

Edit: Guys please, if something here offends you then please let me know, but please do not downvote this, we dont want her to be remembered this way, we want to get the true story out.

 Although words cannot express how greatful I am to Reddit India, words are all I have. So please accept my sincerest appreciation for what you guys have done today, you have, even though you are hundreds of miles from her parents , reduced their suffering in a small way. I and her friends will be eternally greatful  to reddit India for rallying behind this cause, when we band together we can achieve anything, and even though we sit behind screens we have the power to affect people in real life. Thankyou all for believing this story.

Thankyou guys so much once again, and thanks to the mods for being so cooperative. Thankyou ScoopWhoop for owning up to the mistake and not ignoring the truth when it came out. This post is now being circulated all over facebook and my college thanks to the efforts of reddit India.
 
 To Pranita, 
I hope you are in a better place, the college will forever miss seeing your radiating smile everyday.

To those reading, the best thing to do in honour of Pranitas memory is to ensure such places carry warning signs alerting visitors of dangers, as suggested by a redditor [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4m5l2k/my_friend_passed_away_and_toi_made_a_mockery_of/d3t7u30?context=3)

**EDIT:** As of 12PM IST (3rd June)  all the major newshouses have now either taken down the incorrect version, or posted the correct version. I will most likely stop updating this post, unless something major happens. 

Pls also note that I haven't disclosed my identity to anybody **not even to people in my college.**

Till now, only Indian Express has done the most in depth coverage and brought forth the true story, **I urge you all to read from [This Link](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/law-student-who-died-a-selfie-death-of-media-didnt-even-have-her-phone-with-her-2833051/ )**

Only 13 out of 1000 marriages result in a divorce in India. 
It could be due to arranged marriages, society pressure and the stigma attached to it. Most importantly it is because of the financial dependence. 

Low divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages. Failed marriage is not the same as a divorce. Just the absence of divorce doesn’t mean all is well.",Non-Political

I turn on Indian news channels and everyone says ""we always wanted peace, Pakistan doesn't want peace"". 
The media is clearly not truthful on either sides and have been manipulating citizens of both countries for years. 
I just came here to tell you guys that not all Pakistanis hate India and I know not all Indians hate Pakistan. However, we can all agree that both countries have different political differences but we don't hate the people. 
I currently live in the US and I have a lot of Indian friends. We are like family now. It's come to the point that we usually forget that we are from two different countries who hate each other. To us we are all the same. We are all from different religious backgrounds as well but it doesn't matter to us, there is no hatred whatsoever.
We all watch cricket together and recently when India and Pakistan were versing each other we were all having a great time.
Politics and media has ruined us.
Peace and love,

My father suffered a near fatal stroke and his recovery has been slow. We took discharge from the hospital and due to the rising cases of covid-19 and also the doctor suggested to take him home. 

But the fate was not on our side. He started coughing a little bit and had fever. We were still feeding him from feeding tube. Today his health was a little bit down so we decided to take him to the hospital and they screened all of us for Covid-19 due to the symptoms. Fortunately we all are negative. 

In the x-ray,it's showing that his left lung has collapsed completely. These last 2 months have really been awful for us especially for my mother as she isn't really coping well. 

The doctors have suggested there may be pneumonia or positional collapse involved in this case. 
Our family really is in dire need of your help. 

I beg you to contribute whatever you are comfortable with to the fundraiser. Please, we need your help and support. 

[Help my father recover](https://milaap.org/fundraisers/support-pawan-lonare?utm_source=shorturl)

Edit: Thiis is so overwhelming. Thanks for the awards. I'm sure with them the post visibility will increase and get us to the fundraiser amount in no time. Thank you each and everyone so tremendously. Thank you so much.

Uber, Ola: No way to contact customer service directly, have to submit ticket and wait for them to call you. The drivers are all corrupt, 8/10 (bangalore) they will call you up to ask for your destination (which they are not supposed to know) then if they dont like it or if you refuse to tell them they will waste your time sitting in some gully trying to force you to cancel. Yes, it is 8 times out of 10, i am not exaggerating.

&#x200B;

Swiggy, zomato etc - complete garbage. They take the payment but take 0 real responsiblity for what is delivered. Have had 500 rs orders only half delivered, and they refuse to replace or refund giving me a 50 rupee coupon for 250 rupees worth of missing items. Like what the fuck is that? If I wanted to just give away money id stand on a bridge and throw it.

Pizza hut, dominos, other international chains: Completely 100% indianized, only chicken (religous issue? even UAE pizza hut has pork on their menu), KFC removes fries from its menu (but they sell burgers, wtf? and fries are known, world around, to be the highest margin fast food item).

Electricians, handymen, plumbers: never on time, show up whenever they want, get upset when you say you are now busy. Cant install taps correctly (hot is cold, cold is hot), too near the sink so to get water on your hands you have to touch the sink, poor earthing.

ISPs: shit customer service all-round, high speed, yes, but poor connections with high latency, blocking of websites (disgusting to freedom of information)

Mobile service providers: cheap AF, completely overbooked, infrastructure cant cater to the number of people they take on, get 0.2mbps 4g in metros like mg road bangalore even at 2 o clock on a weekday night.

Autos: meter is just for show, at least in bangalore, aggressive, misbehaved if you dont haggle with them off the meter. Dont even know the roads properly.

Cops: useless 100%, show they are advanced with twitter, facebook and incident report apps, 0% response rate (tried to report noise level issue in my area from a nearby construction site, over 30 complaints over 2 months, tweets, facebook messages, no response. One time a cop showed up wasted more of my time than doing anything, takes my picture for some reason, and fucks off.

Even other poorer nations, and other 3rd world countries, are not as shit as ours when it comes to decenly and proper service, public behaviour, etc. This is the shittiest country in the world, to be honest, fuck your Indian pride (proud of what?).

87f85p,My relatives visited me. And I live with my girlfriend unbeknownst to them. And they lost their shit. And it was a thing of beauty. (Re-posting because violated some rules earlier),https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/87f85p/my_relatives_visited_me_and_i_live_with_my/,"Backstory: Last week I broke my ankle and there's a cast around it.  
And also, I tend to be one of the lucky guys in India who lives with his girlfriend. But also unlucky in the sense that a handful of my relatives also live in Delhi.

Here's a highlight of how my last 5 days have been when they visited

* Initially I had to endure gasps, shudders and shivers of them when they realize about my ""Living arrangement"" and how ""apposit Jendaars"" are not supposed to live together.

* Then I experienced a satisfaction almost equal to 1/10th of an orgasm when I saw their faces while they ""inform"" my dad(who couldn't give two shits about it. He's cool like that.)

* Then some other bullshit was uttered around me about homeopathy, patanjali or some pehelwan in some gali or chowk who can cure me within a minute.

* Then came a 2nd wave of gasps and horrific squeals when they realized there is no temple or statue at home.

* In the evening my girlfriend comes from work, so naturally my relatives **HAD** to know what her parents do, earn, spend, overpronate, underpronate???

* Then when they were checking out the rest of the house and saw that the bedroom is being shared (and this is the best part) they acted as if I've murdered their children.

* My bua also got disgusted when she found out I was washing both of ours clothes as it is *ladies* work (This is the only time I was legit pissed) 

* My gf has a full sleeve tattoo for which my maami had a questionnaire ready

* Honb'l mention- It was Navratri and the maid had prepared chicken and rice in Lunch so that was fun.

* Another honb'l mention: All of them know that I drink. Because I got many of my cousins drunk in a family wedding some years back. But when they found the bottles and asked me whether she drinks or not and when I said yes she does. Their immediate response was *But girls can't drink.*  
As if it's anatomically impossible for chicks to drink alcohol.

And I am 24 btw. Just for perspective for how ridiculous they are.

Also my mom told me last night that she got a call from everyone saying  ""*Ladka bohot open ho gaya hai. Iski shaadi karado.*""",Non-Political

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way

* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.

* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan

* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

* Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve. But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

* Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries. [Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistan](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bangladesh-india-citizenship-amendment-bill-pak-afghanistan-modi-hasina-1628304-2019-12-14)


>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

In short, the act is discriminatory in nature as it clearly states that India is only interested in taking non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

e69fln,Possible scam on the huge Youtube tech channel PhoneRadar. I am the winner. Need advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e69fln/possible_scam_on_the_huge_youtube_tech_channel/,"Hello everyone,

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)

My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 

Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 

Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 

Update 4: RIP inbox.

Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!

Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today. 
https://imgur.com/a/7VJhBfP

There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. 

So I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.

Fun Fact: 

* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.
* 3. I happen to meet someone who bragged about his uncle being the toll collector for toll station I had filed RTI, while this whole thing was going on.

I could do all these as I was using office address, whose entry was heavily regulated under STPI laws. **It is 10 years now, but I have been told to never talk about this to anyone, else I may get killed.** Crazy.",Policy/Economy

ar504q,People don't understand the differences between the army and the paramilitary. BUT THEY MUST.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ar504q/people_dont_understand_the_differences_between/,"So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn't very surprising for me as I've been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. 

Following five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):

    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) 
    Border Security Force (BSF) 
    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 
    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) 
    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)

CRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or ""war-like"" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. 

The CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).

CAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay & perks. 

>A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience

>“We’re like a body,” he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. “Just because the heart is more important, you can’t ignore the knee.”

CAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan's viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. 

>Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to ""other"" unspecified medical reasons.

They even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.

> Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include ""lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife"".

TL;DR:

We comfortably deify the army but we don't understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. 

But more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.

b0gd70,Does my period really makes me impure?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b0gd70/does_my_period_really_makes_me_impure/,"I despise my periods not because they hurt me, but because of the amount of crappy rules I'm made to follow. It's unbelievable that people find it so hard to move on with time. If anyone of you have seen the movie padman, you know what I'm talking about. 

I am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.

It's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. 

Does my period really make me so impure?

Edit: Thank you for all the love and support! I honestly didn't know this was that big of a problem until you people pointed it out. Especially the not eating thing. I didn't know it can have long term effects. The problem with that is that if I force my mother to let me eat then she will make me stay in that hell disgusting room for whole 2 days. Sounds like a punishment for eating. 2 days doing nothing looking at walls. That disgusts me a lot I feel like a wasted body or something.",AskIndia

ciddbn,I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ciddbn/i_started_my_btech_degree_yesterday_at_the_age_of/,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

Failure at 25.

Traffic was insane, I was tired, and there were a ton of people in the street. When my Uber arrived, I looked around and realized the super nice, noise canceling headphones I bought before I left the U.S. were gone. I probably got distracted and someone picked them up when I wasn't looking. I was angry at myself for being dumb. I've since been pricing new headphones.

Last night, I got done at the gym and went to the supermarket next to the gym to grab some food. After checking out, the cashier pulled me over to the side of the store and took my headphones out from a cubby by the counter. He saw me drop them nearly 2 weeks ago and grabbed them for me. I'm completely shocked, grateful, and appreciative as this would be a highly unlikely scenario in the U.S. Living/working in India has already been an amazing experience and this only makes it better.",Non-Political

Kudos!,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b57vwb/this_is_massive_india_wins_368_medals_at_special/,"In one of the best sports performances in Indian history, Indian team of 284 athletes have clinched 368 medals at the prestigious Special Olympics World Summer Games held at Abu Dhabi between Mar 14 to 21.

Here's the mind-blowing overall medal tally:

- Gold : 85
- Silver : 154
- Bronze : 129

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

[Their homecoming pictures are the best thing I've seen today.](http://www.newindianexpress.com/galleries/sport/2019/mar/24/special-olympics-indias-medal-winners-return-home-amidst-glitzy-and-glory-102173.html)

These are the smiles that deserved extensive coverage in the media. They deserved interviews. Their stories deserved to be told. They have the potential to inspire and change lives. But, alas, hardly did we even realize that such an incredible feat was even accomplished in India.

Next year I joined a bsc course and dropped after 6 months.

In 2013 I started short term/day trading using my fathers account and did it for a year. While reading a Japanese comic I came across warren buffett's name. After reading 'The intelligent investor' I decided to do long term stock investing. I have been investing for 5 years. a year ago I had a portfolio of 59 lakh of which 45 belonged to my dad and 14 was mine. after a fight with my dad i had to stop investing as it was his account. 2months later he agreed to give me my 14 lakh and told me to gtfo.

&#x200B;

6 months back my mom got a bulge in her l4-l5 lumbar spine. my dad refused to pay for her treatment so i had to chip in.

right now my portfolio is at 10.5 lakh.

I can only read and write in english. I can speak in hindi, tamil, telugu, english.

ffyots,My Covid-19 quarantine experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffyots/my_covid19_quarantine_experience/,"I live and work in Shenzhen, China and was traveling for work in the US when the virus epidemic happened in China. Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought I’ll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.

This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he let’s me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn’t check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24

A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didn’t want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didn’t) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.

My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital ‘held’ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‘negative’ for the virus.

The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you’re away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.

TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative

I am going through a lot. Wanted to come here and rant but when i see good post, i just think, maybe post it next day.

So I first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. The way he stands, the way he looks. Dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.

 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.

Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 

There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.

Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.

All my rants about life just vanished. Problems are still there. I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words. 

Name of boy - Ivaan

Have a blessed day all!

a3karl,"[NP] I called the police and ambulance on a road accident victim. Ambulance shows up in 4 min, police show up in 20.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a3karl/np_i_called_the_police_and_ambulance_on_a_road/,"As described above. Last night on the way from the airport to my place, we saw a body lying in the middle of a three lane road with vehicles overtaking from the either side of him.

I then maneuvered my car to block the middle lane, by stopping the car on the lane, with indicators on.

The accident must have happened not more than 5 min before we reached that spot.

So I called the police. And an ambulance. I called the ambulance first, gave the operator a location, but he didn't know where that was, so the operator asked if I will talk with the ambulance driver and I agreed. I then called police.

As titled, the ambulance was really fast, reached the accident location within 5 min. The police took much longer to show up at about twenty minutes. We spoke with the police for about 5 min and went on our way.

In the end, even though we looked like the perpetrator (when we stopped in front of the victim to block traffic), the police didn't give us any problems.

The purpose of this post was to highlight how the bystander effect is so true. Nobody thought of calling and ambulance or police. Nobody waited to help the victim. Also surprised that an ambulance can show up so quickly.

edit : I have a dashcam. [I just uploaded the file here.](https://gfycat.com/WindingNeedyCod)

edit 2: as u/boredmonk pointed out, I dialed 108 for the ambulance and 100 for police from my friend's mobile phone (on international roaming). No Country code or city code required.

It has been a few years, and I've traveled to other places since, but lately memories from India have helped me stay strong.

Whether it be strolling in the ancient ruins around Hampi, Karnatka, climbing giant boulders and feeling like the king of the world;

Or drifting in the crazy haze of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, feeling the insane energy of life and death strip me of my identity, as I become just another body in the crowd;

Watching the mists roll over the tea plantations in Munnar, Kerala, the light rain on my skin, and feeling inner peace;

Not being able to smile for my photo in front of the Taj Mahal, because I was overcome by beauty and grief;

Climbing to the top of the crowded waterfall in Bhagsu, Himachal Pradesh, and suddenly finding myself Isolated in a beautiful stream, alone save a solitary monk taking a bath in one of the pools;

walking around giant temple complexes in Tamil Nadu, Marveling at the dedication and power of their builders;

Being escorted by a friendly dog half way to the Kheerganga hot springs in Parvati valley, her patiently waiting for me every time I have to slow down;

Getting tremendous help from like 500 different beautiful people whenever I needed something, all over this country;

And finally, quietly sitting in the meditation room in the Buddha memorial park in Patna, Bihar, and finally accepting that it's time to go back home.


Thank you, India. Thank you for all these memories, and a thousand more. I love you and I miss you. Stay the crazy, unique, powerful, beautiful, **wonderful** place that you are.

80toy3,Request: Please treat your office boys and office maids with dignity and respect,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/80toy3/request_please_treat_your_office_boys_and_office/,"Good morning everyone

Had an argument with some obnoxious colleagues in the morning. They are seniors who throw their weight around, and today spent 20 minutes shouting at a hapless office boy, for not keeping a glass of hot tea ready on their desk when they walked in.

They threatened to fire him and reduced him to tears.

I had enough and walked over to them and gave them their due piece of mind. I brought up the history of unacceptable treatment they've been meting out to the office boys and maids, snapping their fingers at them, abusing them over trivial matters, calling them for menial tasks they were well capable of doing themselves.

I stated very loudly that firing the office boys over flimsy charges would lead to cases in the labour court, and the office boy was stunned to know that was even an option.

The arrogant buddhas huffed and puffed and complained to the head of the office, who called me in. Since I work for the Corporate office and don't report to him, he couldn't boss me around, so he told me to calm down and not ""upset the seniors"" in the company. He told me that office boys were used to being treated this way, since ""it's part of their job"".

To anyone still reading, please rid yourselves of this attitude. Office boys and maids are human beings, not servants*. They deserve the same respect, dignity, and kindness you expect from your company.

Please make an effort to know their names (""Arre, Suno"" is not their name!!!!), talk to them once in a while, thank them when they make you a cup of tea, warm your food in the microwave, or come to your desk with some prasad or cake that some other colleague wishes to distribute in the office.

Wash your plates/containers/teacups after eating/drinking. Office is not a hotel, so it's not their duty to clean your utensils.

If you've spilled something on your desk/floor and they have to clean it, apologise to them for the inconvenience. 

If you have to stay back late for work, please take the office keys from them and offer to lock up the office yourself. They typically have to travel far to their home and have to report early to the office, so it's not fair for you to keep them waiting endlessly late in the day. Same for the Sundays when you have to report for duty.

Stand up for them if you see a colleague misbehaving or treating them callously. 

TLDR: Treat your office boys and maids like colleagues. Getting treated like shit is not part of their ""job"". Don't be a lazy slob and take care of minor things yourself in the office.

Thanks for reading, and apologies if I've offended anyone. 

*Edit: Just to add, servants should also be treated with respect and dignity.

A lady came rushing and went straight to the window , at this moment 10-12 mins must have passed and queue was growing as 2 major trains depart and morning rush hour had begun.
I requested her to join the line and got a reply “train is about to come , will miss it” . I said everyone waiting is to board the same train and I informed the ticket guy to not issue a ticket to her. At last she had to leave and she shouted the words “Idiot bastard” and rushed away shedding her pride. Am I the idiot/bastard in this case ?

8v98cy,[Update] Unable to pay college fee. Need financial assistance...,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8v98cy/update_unable_to_pay_college_fee_need_financial/,"A few weeks ago I approached /r/India in distress, after rushing from banks to banks and talking to whoever I can, I was unable to arrange even 1/3rd of the magic 1.6LPM number which could help me pay the fee. The college was not so supportive and banks were reluctant because for some reason I can't get study loan between the course, and some have not even replied till date.

I had offered to create app/website for randians in exchange of some loan, but instead the community came together helped me raise enough amount that I could pay my final year college fee, something i never expected from my fav sub.

I really want to thank the mods who helped me with the idea of fund raiser, 25 of you who helped me financially and hundreds of individual who offered useful  advice, kept asking me if I needed any more help, some were even willing to offer me internship/projects to work on to cover my expenses. It's due to r/India that I was finally able to [pay my fee](https://i.imgur.com/cmP1DXM.png) with a fine of Rs. 200 though.

Not only the community where I have spent hundreds of hours helped me in most generous way possible, as a result of my post seeking help, I made few friends and got to talk to experienced individuals who gave me useful advice related to my college, career and the world in general.

I am really thankful to this community and the mods for helping me out. The community didn't only help me in this case but also my dozens of other posts asking advice for ""friend"" and my alts :D

He makes jokes on Disney(He jokes on many people, corporations anyway). I observed a cut in scene and suspected a censorship. Immediately went to YouTube and watched that particular segment, which clearly didn't have anything censored. This was a particular recurring scene where he says ""Disney Facts"" over a set of jokes.

Hotstar is doing this even after being paid for a premium subscription. Similar censorship has happened in the past after Disney acquisition.

Edit : 
This blew up more than I thought it would. NDTV published an article on this reddit post. Hope hotstar stops censoring. Great going guys!

The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.

**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government: 

[Advocate Rohit Bras de Sa files letter petition before HC on account of scarcity of essential commodities & lack of machanism to provide basic food supply to vulnerable wage workers, says people of Goa are struggling to find even basic goods to sustain themselves in curfew days](https://twitter.com/prudentgoa/status/1243101931666468869)

If you want to lend your support on Twitter, retweet the following tweet en mass. It's from Zoe, a foreign national, who's been trying to get international media's attention on the issue: 

[Brits & foreigners stranded in Goa, India. The state has closed all shops for past three days.

Just like how you were once new to the internet and you were amazed and puzzled by different things, they will also experience the same, but the difference is that they are like the new student who joined the school in the middle of the year. They have to now put twice as effort than you did in the past because everything has evolved so much and there are so many things to know about.

They are new to everything and they will be naive. They will fall into scams and will be exploited. They will be made fun of as they don't know the social etiquette of the internet which you have got used to. They may not even understand English properly or may not understand the underlying technologies which may seem obvious to you.

However, remember that you were also like that once up a time. Perhaps you were privileged to be able to use the internet while it was still a young new thing, but imagine how you would have felt if everyone you met online were a bully to you. Remember that Internet became what it is because there were forums and sites for helping each other on every topic you can think of.

I am saying this because I often see new users being abused by the Internet as the whole.

I am cancelling my connections and I hope what I say in this post are compelling enough for you to support me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aeblpo/r_please_dont_get_jio_gigafiber_and_i_have/,"I am copying and pasting from a [comment I made in another thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/adu4hg/indias_massive_jio_carrier_is_blocking_vpn_sites/edkyke4/), after someone suggested that I should make a thread about this.

Jio is using

1. Deep packet inspection
2. Carrier-grade NAT
3. Poorly configured stateful IPv6
4. Almost completely locked down router with some non-sequitor options
5. Clueless customer service, who just say ""we can't talk about X or Y or Z"" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they'll say they can't help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. 

The first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.

To explain in more detail:

1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.
2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.
 * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.
3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven't really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.
 * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.
4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.
5. Jio's customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don't have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won't even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.
 * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!

I will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move. It's not ideal, but I'm kinda stuck with that one.",Science/Technology

e5rae3,Rant: In India everything matters except the real issues.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5rae3/rant_in_india_everything_matters_except_the_real/,"Have you ever felt that us Indians have this sick tendency to completely ignore the elephant in the room while we whine and get offended about every single thing that is not important? As an Indian international student; after observing the Western European education system, I am shocked to see how radically different it is than our own system. I personally think that it is due to the fact that us Indians are conditioned since we are toddlers to put our unrelenting faith in our ""elders"". The only problem is that many of our so called  ""elders"" are also normal human beings with their own problems and flaws. 

When I first went abroad, I remember how some of our jealous relatives were taunting my parents about how I will lose all my ""culture"", ""riti-riwaz"" after stepping out the country even though I was only going for a couple of months. I literally had to touch the feet of 10 thousand different people to get a proper dose of ashirwad before finally boarding the plane and literally had a back pain throughout the entire flight. Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random ""aunty"" who you don't give a flying fuck about; you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are force-fed the idea of andh deshbhakti; you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society. I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised, I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family. 

  
My point is simple. I really do not mind culture, traditions, riti or riwaz. I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture; however, I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems, facts and logic that this country is so deprived of.  

This is also where it gets really dark. If you are someone who has ability to think critically or you're someone with a certain level of common sense, living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism. You don't touch the feet of your relatives? You scoundrel! You come late to a pooja? That's sacrilege! You hang out with non vegetarian friends? Chiee!!  You believe India can be more secular? deshdhrohi! 

I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of anti-intellectualism in India. It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as ""Whatsapp university"" and ""Facebook pathshala"" but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner. 

Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you don't put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws. Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season. Instead of blaming the municipality for this, he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle. 

In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like ""bacche man ke sacche"" when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls, and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher, you get harassed and abused mentally, emotionally and physically. 

You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people, while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees. I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids. The more you travel around the world, the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens! 

How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back. And yes! I know! There are other countries that have the same problem; however, I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!

The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the ""cultured"" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person!   


I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news, whatsapp, twitter; or even listen to my own relatives and friends, I feel utterly nihilistic. I hope things take turns for the better in India but I won't bet my money on it so because when you combine religion, symbolism, politics, and fake superiority complex, then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands.

Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person, it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder.",Politics

Ours is a resource limited setting, a poor nation with dirt poor patients. The whole country is in lockdown and people are in frenzy. The cases aren’t that many but they’re increasing fast. Our government has this shitty criteria to decide who gets screened for COVID and who doesn’t. Only the symptomatic people with either a history of travel abroad in past 2 weeks or those with a direct contact with a confirmed case get tested. This criteria is so stringent that out of the hundred people that I see in a day, I hardly send one or two for testing. And I am not even counting the hundreds who are attended at a separate ‘flu clinic’ and don’t even see the face of the screening centre. I don’t know whether the government can’t afford the testing kits or it doesn’t want to reveal the true picture, all I know is that we are sitting on a time bomb. What I hate the most is arguments with patients. They come a long way, facing a lot of hardships just to reach our centre and we are forced to turn them away. Literally every single person I see over a six hour period calls me useless because I won’t test them. They’re frustrated and so am I. My hands are tied by the rules and they just need someone to take it out on, and we keep on being the scapegoats in between. I used to be the kind of person who would reach first to the hospital and would be the last to leave but I hate going to work now, I dread talking to people knowing all I am going to do is let them down. Not to mention the hardships I have to face just to reach the hospital from my place of residence because our government has shut down literally every mode of conveyance. So I walk an hour everyday to work only to be cursed by patients and only to put my own health at risk. Please advise your children to not become a doctor. Atleast not in this country.",Unverified

For it was a nation who discriminated against religion. For it was a nation who fueled terrorism against said religion. And so I did. 


* I rejoiced when their prime minister got imprisoned. 

* I rejoiced when their image in the world was reduced to a terrorist nation. 

* I rejoiced each time our cricket team won against theirs. 

* I rejoiced when their diplomatic relationships were shattered. 


As I walked in the mist of ignorance rarely did I see the hypocrisy of my own country, and how could I? It was so pure and true. How can Mother India be anything but holy? 


And as the mist grew thick, I saw the hate crimes against the Muslims of our country. I felt infuriated for I was taught to conjure brotherhood towards all the people of my beloved country.
But how could I? 
*Was I not supposed to discriminate against the Muslims for that is what my ever so righteous parents did?*
All I was but a green child, and so I kept quiet. 



* I kept quiet as they were killed for eating beef. 

* I kept quiet as their fortunes were stripped away by the mobs of unruly. 
* I kept quiet as the government increasingly drifted away from harbouring secularism. 
* I kept quiet as hate crimes became rampant.
* I kept quiet as students were harassed. 



But now the Eastern wind blows wild and the mist falls. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I grow grave with fear that my beloved country is becoming the very thing I was taught to despise. 

*Was I not taught the virtues of secularism? 
Was I not taught the value of equality? 
How can I let my country become the pit of what it stood on?*

Nope. After dinner, they put the kids to sleep. In my berth. Refusing to give it back. Ok, whatever. I'm not going to see them again after I get down. All good, right? 

Nope. They've decided they want the entire fucking thing to themselves so they've been making life hell to get rid of me. Thankfully, I have a friend in another berth so I've been staying there but whenever I come back to get something or to lie down, they begin shouting, playing music, beating the kids (?!) until I leave. They woke me at 5 in the fucking morning blasting shitty music till I got up and left. 

This is a seat that I've paid a fair bit of money for. How in the fuck can people justify this sort of behavior? Fuck this and fuck them. I'm getting down in 6 hours. 6 long, miserable hours.",Non-Political

Heres the short version

Thugs in front of me start a fight with me unprovoked because I did not stand up for the national anthem.

I get hit on the face and they incite a crowd against me. They close in and shouting threats to my life.

INOX PULLS ME OUT, and left the thugs there. Thank e manager was flippant towards me and when the police got involved he wrote his case report supporting the mob and against me.

The thugs basically write some hit down and are left free. I was detained for bogus charges for not standing up and 'hurting the dignity of the soverign nation'

Not one person stood up for me when a mob threated my life. I am absolutely disgusted with everyone that was present yesterday.

Im still seething from the injustice and urge you all to boycott inox. That was absolutely unacceptable.

Also for disclosure, I did unload an unholy fuckton of insults and swears on the thugs and subsequent audience that went after me, they were all triggered. But not once did I threaten bodily harm unprovoked. Nor did I shout threats at peoples lives.",Unverified

That gang was led by Susanta Chowdhury, a criminal under the umbrella of the local politicians. These criminals used to rape every young woman in the small village named Sutiya in West Bengal (2000 to 2002). Sometimes, they went to the house of a villager and raped the women inside the house, often in front of the whole family. They used to keep records of every little girl who became mature enough to rape. People who tried to protest were mercilessly butchered. No reports of rape and murder were allowed to be known to the police or media. 

Barun Biswas, a school teacher organized the villagers against these demons. He led the raped women to go to the police and media. The whole village came out to support the teacher in his fight for justice.

After that there was a great media and public outrage which compelled the police to capture the criminals and bring them to justice. There were 33 rape cases and also 12 murder cases registered against them (the actual number of rapes were atleast 5 or 6 times more). The ring leader with his four main gang members were given life sentences. Some of the accused were released due to lack of evidence.

In 2002, Barun was shot dead by some of the freed members of that gang near Goboardanga railway station while returning from his school. He is a real hero and people of the area still revered him as a legend.

Edit: Barun was shot dead in 2012. Sorry for the mistake.",[R]eddiquette

He seems to be having a really hard time with the adjustment. I want to teach my son some phrases that he can say to the boy so that he knows he has a friend. I don't know what language he speaks but I know he calls his Dad ""Nana""?  Can someone help us with some simple stuff like ""do you want to play"" or ""friend"" or something?  Also any advice would be helpful.

Edit:. Also, I speak only English and Spanish so I need help with pronunciation. :)

Edit:. I'll keep everybody updated. The little boy wasn't at school on Friday because he doesn't come on Fridays I learned. Monday is a holiday here so they won't be in class together until Tuesday at the earliest. My kid picked up on the phrases really quickly and is excited to get to use them!  Thank you so much everybody for your help. I will absolutely let you know how it goes!  Also, thank you for the gold kind stranger!

Update:. Daycare never found out the right language. :(. Although, it doesn't turn out that it really makes a difference. His little friend is picking up English really quickly and not crying anymore at school.  Thank you all so much for your information. It did help my son try and find ways to connect, which means that he made a little friend anyway. Kids really do learn so fast! I'm very glad that my son was sympathetic to his situation.

I’m an American who was dating a guy from India. We’re both in our late 20s, he’s Catholic, from Kerala, and we had been dating for over a year.

He flew to India to visit his family last September. He said he wanted to go early in the year so that we could spend Christmas and New Years together. But instead he started ghosting me for a couple of weeks and when I wouldn’t stop texting him as I was worried, he finally replied with a long breakup text. He said his parents were retiring and so he was moving back to India forever to help his parents move, and said he had no choice but to break up with me and wants me to move on.

I recently found out from his Whatsapp photo that it wasn’t true at all…in reality he just got married, and he's still working in the states. I have not attempted to contact nor confront him since before he dumped me via text message -- his text was the last piece of communication between us.

I’ve read in passing that it’s not unheard of for NRI's to dump their foreign girlfriends right before they tie the knot with someone in their community, so easily like it’s some sort of past time. And then it becomes this deep dark secret they laugh about with their mates after work. Please tell me this isn't true? When I told our mutual Indian friend about this, he (the friend) was more in disbelief/shock by the fact that it happened to me rather than *what* had happened.

I’m torn between feeling devastated vs. feeling pure anger and hatred like I was just manipulated by a sociopath for over a year. We were each other’s best friend, we loved each other, made a bunch of other forever-promises that couples do… Or was he just practicing for his future wife...",Non-Political
